        "First Quote 1": "One of the best massages I’ve ever had! Before the massage she asked me if anything hurt, or if she should focus on any areas.  I told her that my lower back and neck were a bit tight.  She was able to focus on the lower back and neck, and helped stretch my legs, arms, and lower back. She was able to apply good appropriate pressure.  I find that a lot of massage therapists aren’t able to apply enough pressure, but that was no issue for Rei, the pressure was perfect, and at the end of the massage I felt loose and relaxed.  Would definitely recommend and go again!",
